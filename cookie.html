            Purpose of the policy,<br />
            This document describes tracking technologies (“trackers”) that help
            this website achieve the purposes outlined in this document.
          </p>
          <p class="policy__text">
            What are trackers? <br />
            Cookies are a type of technology that is considered a “Tracker,”
            which are intended to enhance and simplify the user's experience
            with the website. This document discusses the role of Trackers in
            general. The term Cookie is only used when the discussion is limited
            Cookies and not applicable to Trackers in general.
            <br /><br />
            EcoEquity requires user consent to use some Trackers. Whenever
            consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following
            the instructions provided in this document. This website uses
            trackers managed directly by the Company (“first-party” trackers)
            and trackers that enable services provided by a third-party
            (“third-party” trackers). Unless otherwise specified within this
            document, third-party providers may access the trackers they manage.
            <br /><br />
            The validity and expiration periods of cookies and other similar
            trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by us or the
            relevant provider. Some Trackers expire upon termination of the
            user's browsing session. In addition to information contained in
            each of the descriptions for the categories below, the most precise
            and current information regarding lifetime specifications as well as
            any other relevant information — such as the presence of other
            Trackers— in the linked privacy policies of the respective
            third-party providers or by contacting us.
          </p>
          <p class="policy__text" id="contact_info">Contact Information</p>

          <p class="policy__text">
            Since the use of third-party trackers through this website cannot be
            fully controlled by us, any specific references to third-party
            trackers are to be considered indicative. In order to obtain
            complete information, you are kindly requested to consult the
            privacy policies of the respective third-party services listed in
            this document. Given the objective complexity surrounding tracking
            technologies, you are encouraged to contact us should you wish to
            receive any further information on the use of such technologies by
            this website. <br /><br />

            Activities strictly necessary for the operation of this website and
            delivery of the service
          </p>
          <p class="policy__text">
            The website uses so-called “technical” Cookies and other similar
            Trackers to execute activities that are strictly necessary for the
            operation or delivery of the service. While visitors to the website
            may opt-out of these Trackers and Cookies, it is highly likely if
            the visitor opts-out that some or all website functions and content
            will not function or be accessible.

            Improving the User Experience <br />
            This website uses Trackers to improve the quality of the user
            experience and enable interactions with external content, networks,
            and platforms.
            <br /><br />
            Displaying content from external platforms <br />
            This type of service allows you to view content hosted on external
            platforms directly from the pages of this website and interact with
            them. Such services are often referred to as widgets, which are
            small elements placed on a website or app. They provide specific
            information or perform a particular function and often allow for
            user interaction. This type of service might still collect web
            traffic data for the pages where the service is installed, even when
            you do not use it.

            Managing preferences and opting out
          </p>
          <p class="policy__text">
            Users may manage Tracker related preferences and provide and
            withdraw consent for the Company to use Trackers and Cookies.
            <br /><br />
            Certain devices allow users to manage Tracker and Cookie preferences
            directly from device settings. Also, when the use of Trackers is
            based on user consent, the user can provide or withdraw such consent
            by setting the preferences within the Cookie notice or in some cases
            by updating such preferences through the consent-preferences privacy
            options on the website. It may also be possible to use the browser
            or device features to delete previously stored Trackers, including
            those used to remember the initial consent preferences. Other
            Trackers in the browser's local memory may be cleared by deleting
            the browsing history.
            <br /><br />
            With regard to any third-party trackers, you can manage your
            preferences via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using
            the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by
            contacting the third party.

          On mobile apps, users may be able to manage preferences and opt-out
          for certain categories of Trackers through relevant device settings
          such as the advertising device setting. These functions are generally
          found in the device settings.
          <br /><br />
          Consequences of disabling or opting out from the use of Trackers
          <br />
          Enabling the use of Trackers is at the user's discretion. However,
          Trackers are utilized to help EcoEquity operate the website, provide a
          better user experience, and improve and enhance the website's
          functionalities. Therefore, if users block or opt-out of certain
          Trackers, EcoEquity may be unable to provide certain features that
          rely on those Trackers.
